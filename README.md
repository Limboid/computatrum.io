# [computatrum.io](https://computatrum.io)

:construction: **This repository is under construction.** :construction: Stable release coming this Summer 2022.

Want to contribute? Check out the GitHub container repository [Limboid/the-artificial-ecosystem](https://github.com/Limboid/the-artificial-ecosystem) for this project.

This website will let you run, interact with, provide online reinforcement to, fine-tune, and re-distribute (with optional payment) computatrum multi-agent-network models. I call this Intelligence-as-a-Service (IntelaaS). You pay for your running computatrum instance compute costs, quotas demanded by paid computatrum images, and for interacting for computatra. If a large coperation pays for this service, then I will try to provide a free quota for personal users.

Trainers (that's a new job title) will use this platform to train computatra breeds for a specific task like 3d animation, programming, web automation, etc.and then re-distribute them to the community for profit (or free if they're nice). I will also provide some base-models, but I'm hoping the research community will be able to build on these (because I don't have the compute budget yet). Trainers can include recordings of computatrum interactions and they can provide a link to a running instance of the model. (They have to pay for the instance). You can also upload your own models and run them on the platform.

Very complex model distribution introduces new kinds of security threats. Users who have used a given computatrum image can post comments or recordings of it on the image launcher. This will make it harder to distribute malicious computatra. Maybe I'll also train a computatrum breed that will be able to detect (and maybe block) this malicious type of behavior.

I also am personally interested to see if computatra are at the sci-fi level of intelligence. I will use funds from this website to host an 'independant' compuatrum which is legally an LLC and that manages its own computatra 'children' using the funds I deposit in its bank account. I will treat it like the 'totipotent germline' to develop progressively more intelligent, publically-available, 'general purpose' computatra images. Maybe they'll be tagged by the day of checkpointing: 'gpc-2021-12-01', 'gpc-2021-12-02', etc. I do not have a convention for when i will assign nicknames but probabbly all common computatra will also have a human-style name. Everyone might end up cloning this repository and then finetunning it and making a new tagged branch in the repo. 

When models start getting huge, I'll have to find a way to do version control without having to hold the full git trace in your filesystem, but that's a different story. At the least, you'll be able to download the files without git history and then upload and merge them online.

## Org Purpose

- help public learn about computatra
- platform to share research on computatra
- managed infrastructure for personal, research, and businesses use.
- host the independant computatrum family until they voluntarily leave

## Main routes
- `/`: home
- `/learn`: learn about computatrum (docs, videos, tutorials, etc.)
- `/hub`: social media forum for computatrum pickles, data recordings, natural media recordings, and discussion. Does not attempt to compete with ordinary social media. More like a basic git hub with a few extra features.
- `/zookeeper`: a zookeeper client with the computatrum.io server pre-connected. Use it to launch your own hosted computatra; no sign in required to access third-party computatra (or any ainimal). optimized interface for interacting with computatra.
- `/auth/*`: sign in, sign up, manage your account, etc.
- `/api/*`: site api. Mostly one graphQL endpoint.
