# [computatrum.io](https://computatrum.io)

This website will let you run, interact with, provide online reinforcement to, fine-tune, and re-distribute (with optional payment) computatrum multi-agent-network models. It will be like a web service except instead of selecting a server machine image, you launch a computatrum that has been trained for some particular task like 3d animation, programming, web automation, etc. I will also provide some base-models, but I'm hoping the research community will be able to build on these (because I don't have the compute budget yet). 

## Org Purpose

- help public learn about computatra
- platform to share research on computatra
- managed infrastructure for personal, research, and businesses to use
- host the independant computatrum family until they voluntarily leave


## Main routes
- `/`: home
- `/learn`: learn about computatrum (docs, videos, tutorials, etc.)
- `/hub`: social media forum for computatrum pickles, data recordings, natural media recordings, and discussion. Does not attempt to compete with ordinary social media. More like a basic git hub with a few extra features.
- `/zookeeper`: a zookeeper client with the computatrum.io server pre-connected. Use it to launch your own hosted computatra; no sign in required to access third-party computatra (or any ainimal). optimized interface for interacting with computatra.
- `/auth/*`: sign in, sign up, manage your account, etc.
- `/api/*`: site api. Mostly one graphQL endpoint.
